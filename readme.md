# dtk

This is a D wrapper of the Tcl/Tk graphics library. It's based on Tcl/Tk v8.6.0.0.

**Note:** The project is still in pre-alpha quality condition.

This code was originally based on lysevi's [dkinter](https://github.com/lysevi/dkinter) project, which has been stale for many years.

Currently it's only tested on Windows 7.

## Building

Make sure you're using the latest compiler. Sometimes that even means using the latest git-head version
(sorry about that).

Run the `build.bat` file to both run the unittests and generate a static library in the `bin` subfolder.
